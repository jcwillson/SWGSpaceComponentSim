# SWGSpaceComponentSim

This project uses SWG-Source code to copy the random function and calculations used to generate loot in SWG and output the stats into CSV files.

The program prompts for an output file path, and creates a folder structure to organize parts by type and RE level.

Currently the program only handles outputting X simultions of all droppable components.

Planned to allow more granular simulation of specific subsets and even individual componeonts.
